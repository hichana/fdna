# PROJECT SUMMARY
- Flow DNA strands are building blocks for experiences on Flow
- a Flow DNA strand comprises nft type base pairs as an ordered and immutable sequence that can only ever be created once
- any holder of two or more Flow NFTs can potentially claim a Flow DNA strand
- users can select and reorder NFTs from their Flow wallet to create the two parallel helices of their Flow DNA strand
- on-chain helper functions and sample Cadence scripts allow any Flow ecosystem project to easily query Flow DNA data from users
- people who are new to Web3 can find links to the many great Flow marketplaces so they can buy NFTs and build their DNA strands

# BUILD APPROACH
-x scaffold app with basic emulator contracts deployment
-x build overflow emulator setup automation, adding transactions and scrips to confirm basic app requirements
    - develop contracts as much as possible I do this
- scaffold web app
- build basic app use case placeholder UI elements
- circle back to contracts, working on building data for string interpolated version of mint tx in frontend while also connecting UI elements to flow scripts and transactions
- build out layout, design, artwork
- create hackathon submission
- checklist before testnet deploy/submission
    - must have collection and NFT artwork created and links added to STRANDS, all other metadata strings must be right
    - in minter, update mint strings for thumbnail and thumbnail path
    - in fcl config, change app.detail.icon

# REQUIREMENTS
- external
    - as soon as one or more exampleNFT contracts are suitable and working as expected on emulator, need to submit to testnet nft catalog
-x .env
    - contains all appropriate env vars suffixed if necessary with environment (emulator, testnet, mainnet)
-x fcl config
    - has conditional loading of config based on env var
-x flow config and deploy
    -x init flow.json
    -x add core contracts to repo
- app
    - sets up env var in dev scripts
    - has method for constructing mint transaction code for variable data received from nft catalog via user dna building process
    - has configuration for using aliased paths in web app modules
    - has helper to replace string imports to allow for using cadence inside svelte
    - integrates tailwind css
    -x makes a .env available for use in web app and flow.json
    - integrates prettier, svelte prettier plugin
    - includes ignore files for git and prettier
- UI
    - user can see a CTA to start building a Flow NFT collection -- includes descriptive text about this project and Web3/Flow, links to marketplaces and projects, and to the four OG Bases FLOATS
    - user can login using Blocto and other wallets
    - user can see a list of all NFT projects for which their wallet contains a collection that is registered in the nft catalog
    - user can expand the list of NFT projects to reveal the NFTs and their metadata (displays image) from their wallet
    - user can toggle a checkbox next to each of their NFTs to select or deselect any number of their NFTs to include when building their Flow DNA strand
    - selected NFTs appear can be arranged inside of two vertical dnd palletes to signify they are "base pairs"
    - users can click/tap drag NFT data between vertical dnd to build and rearrange base pairs
    - with each re-arrange of base pairs, user is informed whether or not that permutation of Flow DNA for either side is taken or not
    - user can mint their Flow DNA strand, showing transaction status throughout the process and providing a link to the transaction on flowscan
    - user can see a card representing their Flow DNA strand with a list of the DNA string identifiers from each strand
- app testing/automation (all use overflow)
    - has a testing utils that can be used with an integration test
    - basic integration test to test DNA building and minting
    -x setup script registers projects to the nft-catalog and demonstrates the whole minting process
    -x scripts automate processes on testnet
    - has testnet scripts and transactions
        - setup account to receive royalties
        - give demo user NFTs 
    - tests

    - link to live version of project
        - web app
        - flowscan account with smart contracts
    - list of code used from other projects (ex. ExampleNFT, flow nft catalog scripts and transactions, etc.)
- testnet deployment
    - script populates test user with exampleNFTs in their wallet
-x emulator
    -x manages accounts and testnet and mainnet deployments
    -x deploys nft catalog with example NFT contracts registered to nft catalog
    -x demo user is issued example NFTs
- repo/docs
    - scripts examples walkthrough for pulling DNA data
    - examples of how DNA data can be leveraged across NFT experiences
- smart contracts and scripts/transactions
    - NFTCatalog, NFTCatalogAdmin, NFTRetrieval (not deployed to testnet)
        - get nfts in account
        - get nfts in account from ids
    - Strands
        - has appropriate events
        -x can mint nfts
        -x on contract init
            -x sets royalty receiver(s)
            -x sets NFT sales payment receiver
            -x gives deployer admin resources
        -x has admin resource given to deployer with functions to
            - start or pause minting (checked by minter)
            - change nft royalty receiver
            - change nft payment receiver
        - nft stores nft-catalog data for each NFT added to the DNA
        - integrates DNA data with the metadata standard Traits view
        - maintains a registry of DNA strands as strings that are comma-separated list of fully qualified identifiers, ex: A.[address].[contract-name].[nft-id]
            - key is strand string and value is a struct representing minter data, like wallet address, timestamp
        - admin can set the mint price in Flow tokens
        - NFT resource members include
            - a 'basePairs' [[String]] member to represent the ordered double-stranded/helix in DNA
            - a string representation of each strand ('helix1' and 'helix2'), where the string is a comma-separated list of fully qualified identifiers, ex: A.[address].[contract-name].[nft-id]
        - minter
            - constructs each DNA strand's concatenated string identifier and checks it against the registry, panicing if it already exists in the registry
            - when constructing the DNA strands, adds each ref or ref string to a strand1 and strand2 array, checks length of both, panicking if the length of each is different
        - provides public methods for retrieving DNA records
            - function provides getting data in 'base pairs', [[String]]
        - metadata
            - number of base pairs

    - Strand.cdc metadata art
    - ExampleNFT.cdc metadata art
- project repo
    - includes instructions for judges to deploy and run the app locally and on testnet
- project deployment (vercel)
    - includes appropriately scoped env var for flow_env, and any others that may use conditional logic

# ICEBOX/STRETCH REQUIREMENTS
- use AuthAccount (in minter) to verify person minting actually owns the NFTs rather than just checking resource owner and comparing against deposit collection address
- web app background cylces between green, purple, blue and yellow
- query params to save user state
- when minting, uses some kind of confetti with double helix art
- in my submission, include a dev.to post called 'the story of FLOW DNA' where I talk about over-engineering a solution with my recursive node structure for The FLOASIS, and why I chose to re-do/build it from the ground up and offer to other builders. "Because concatenated strings just looked yucky to me"

# MAINNET
- would need to process tx for mainnet service account to receive royalties
- OG Bases FLOATs
    - four limited FLOATs ("A", "G", "C", "T") that anyone can get to bootstrap their NFT collection and start building Flow DNA right away
