		STRANDS is an NFT project with the mission to promote the ownership of many and varied NFTs on Flow.
		We believe many great experiences and brands will come about if we find ways to encourage more composability
		of NFTs from many different projects. To create it youâ€™ll need to own two or more Flow NFTs. There
		are a lot of awesome ones out there from great marketplaces. If you need to grab a few before minting
		your STRAND, checkout
