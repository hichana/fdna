        a: "Not every project actually delivers on their roadmap, so beyond making cool little digital DNA NFTs on Flow, we're not promising things that might not happen. Want a roadmap? Come into our Discord, chat, share your STRAND of DNA, and help us find out what to do next! PS. for a counter-example to NFT projects that over-promise yet under-deliver, see Flovatar's site and scroll down to their roadmap. They're geniuses at continually building and delivering value for their community. Love love love me some Flovatar!!!"
