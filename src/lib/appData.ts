	{
		q: 'How does STRAND work?',
		a: "On Flow, we have something called the NFT Metadata Standard. Almost all NFT projects on Flow now expose project, collection and NFT data through this standard, open for anyone to consume. In blockchain, this is one example of 'composability', as this project and others can use that on-chain data for other experiences. When you mint a STRANDS of Flow DNA, you use the metadata from NFTs in your wallet to build a digital double helix of Flow NFT identifiers that become base pairs. We don't actually touch your NFTs, we just make *references* to them to create your DNA. Each side of the double helix strand itself has two strands, strandA and strandB. For each of those strands, the unique permutation of NFT types (the composition and order) are memorialized on the Flow blockchain, so they can never be minted twice."
	},
	{
		q: 'What does a STRANDS of Flow DNA look like?',
		a: "STRANDs of Flow DNA are meant to be simple and extensible to other, future experiences on Flow. So there isn't any kind of 3D rendering that would look old in a few years anyways. It's just an image that represents STRANDS, your chosen base pairs, and other metdata. In blockchain, simple can sometimes be the best because it opens projects up for further composability across other experiences. We want creative people to take STRANDS to create cooler stuff on top of the on-chain Flow DNA. We etch your DNA into the transaction that minted your NFT, and we embed representations of your STRANDS DNA into the metadata of your NFT, on-chain."
